### About
**International Doom** is a small, functional, and minimalist source port, built with help, collaboration, and code contributions from people around the world. It is based on [Chocolate Doom](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom) and [Crispy Doom](http://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom), with notable additions from [DOOM Retro](https://github.com/bradharding/doomretro).

The mission of the project is to offer a choice between an enhanced and a classic gameplay experience.

International Doom supports high rendering resolutions, visual improvements, and optional gameplay adjustments, while preserving the ability to play in the spirit of the original vanilla Doom.

All enhancements are disabled by default — the port allows the player to decide which features to enable.
Special attention is given to visual design, cross-platform compatibility, and low system requirements.

The project is created by [Julia Nechaevskaya](mailto:julia.nechaevskaya@live.com).
